Premium Beat Flash Music Player 

This will remove all the mp3 players files and integration hooks.
You must manually delete or disable your PHP block code.
If you performed any manual edits to your index files to install this player, you must remove them.
The mp3 entries will remain in the settings database, and will be usable again if this modification is re-installed.
(Unless deleted manually via FTP and myphpadmin)
